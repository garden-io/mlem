# MLEM — Machine Learning Excluding Math

This is the content for [Ellen](https://twitter.com/ellenkorbes)'s talk _Learn Neural Networks With Go — Not Math!_.

The current version runs locally. The full app will be available in the coming days.

Under `libs/` you will find three versions:
- Version 1 has only basic neurons.
- Version 2 has neuron layers and activation functions.
- Version 3 is the full neural network.
